# OrderedStack

*OrderedStack* is a program I first created for Project 4 as *OrderedLinkedList*.  Later, the specifications were changed for Project 5 and the program was renamed to *OrderedStack*.

This simple program was written for my CSC6301 class while working towards my Masters in Computer Science.
