# Project 6

*OrderedStack* is a program I first created for Project 4 as *OrderedLinkedList*.  Later, the specifications were changed for Project 5 and the program was renamed to *OrderedStack*.

This simple program was written for my CSC6301 class while working towards my Masters in Computer Science.

## Project 4

Project 4 contains the *OrderedLinkedList* program which takes a list of integers from a Scanner, sort them in ascending order, then stores them in a Linked List.

## Project 5

Project 5 contains the program *OrderedStack* based on *OrderedLinkedList* from Project 4 but instead of storing the result in a Linked List, the result is stored in a Stack.
