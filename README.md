# Project 6

This repository contains the work submitted as Project 6 for the class CSC6301.  This includes the .java files for projects 4 and 5.

I debated how to best show both projects, as Project 5 is based on Project 4.  I originally tried storing both projects as the history of a single .java file that changed names, but I didn't like how it wasn't displayed obviously that I had uploaded both projects.  I then decided to contain the two projects in their own individual folders.

## Project 4

Project 4 contains the *OrderedLinkedList* program which takes a list of integers from a Scanner, sorts them in ascending order, then stores them in a Linked List.  This Linked List is then displayed to the user.

## Project 5

Project 5 contains the *OrderedStack* program based on *OrderedLinkedList* from Project 4 but instead of storing the result in a Linked List, the result is stored in a Stack.  This Stack is then displayed to the user.

## Installation

These projects only require a basic Java installation to run.  There are no additional dependencies.

## Usage

Upon running the program, the user is prompted to enter a list of integers followed by a non-integer and Enter.

```bash
Please input integers separated by spaces, enter a non-integer and Enter to finish:
```

The program then sorts the list of integers and stores them in either a Linked List (Project 4) or Stack (Project 5).  The program displays the sorted contents of the Linked List/Stack.

```bash
Here are the contents of the Stack:
```
